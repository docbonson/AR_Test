# AR_Test
A very basic use of Google Sceneform to generate 3D assets onto a plane.
Still running into a few issues with emulator crashing. Currently working on a fix for that.

- Adding Sceneform to the Android application to handle ARCore session creation, requesting camera permission, as well as provide common UX elements.
- Importing 3D models to Android Studio project.
